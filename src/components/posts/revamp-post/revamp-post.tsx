            So in my first blog post I mentioned how I would probably make like 3 posts or something and then redesign the blog like four times.<br/>
            Yeah that's exactly what happened ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
          </p>
          <p>The site you are now reading on is probably the fourth or maybe even fifth redesign of my blog in the space of like 4 months or something.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The very first iteration was made using <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction'>web components</a>.</li>
            <li>The second iteration used a react based framework called <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://nextjs.org/'>next.js</a>.</li>
            <li>The third and fourth designs were both built in <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://www.gatsbyjs.org/'>GatsbyJS</a> another react based framework</li>
            <li>This fifth iteration is back to native web components however im now using a web components compiler called <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://stenciljs.com/'>StencilJS</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>At this rate im going to have remade my site in every frontend framework and technology possible. ü§£</p>
